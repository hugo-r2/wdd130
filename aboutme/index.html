    <h2>Hugo Reyes</h2>
    <h2>Huguito</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Hugo Isaac Reyes Reyes, and I am from Guatemala City. </p>

    <p>I am currently engaged and planning to get married on March 15th, so I am very excited about that, but I am also verys nervous due to the many things that you need to do to plan a wedding. But I am definitely enjoying this whole experience. I met my fiance√© at one of our single youth parties. We didn't know at that time how in love we would be later that same year. I really love her and hope we can seal that love in the temple in the next few monts. </p>

    <p>I work in a call center helping customers to get mechanical apointments to fix their cars. I am looking for other job opportunities that could make me grow even more as a person. I am very excited about this class and the opportunities it can provide.</p>

    <p>I have been a member of the church since I was born, my mom served as a missionary here in Guatemala, and her example has helped me follow Christ and keep his commandments. I also served a mission a few years ago, but I served in Argentina. That experience has helped me to feel the love of Christ in ways that I didn't experience before.</p>
